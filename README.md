1st: Open Google Colab or VSC and create a new folder where we will put this .ipynb file

2nd: Move the file we want to translate to this folder along with the translation file that will already be in this folder.

3rd: Finally, change the names that are below the translation file, where it says input.ipynb we put the file we want to translate and in output.ipynb it will be the name of the file that is translated.
